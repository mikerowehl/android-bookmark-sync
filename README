Android Bookmark Sync
Mike Rowehl (mikerowehl@gmail.com)

Very simple Android app for pulling down a JSON file via HTTP, parse it, and
merge any URLs that don't exist already into the Browser bookmarks.  Once
they're merged in you can find them in the bookmarks section of the default
browser just like you should be able to.

The format expected for the JSON:

- top level item 'bookmarks' containing an array
- each array item has a 'url' and optionally a title

Example JSON content:

{"bookmarks":[{"url":"http:\/\/rowehl.com\/","title":"Mike Rocks!"},{"url":"http:\/\/rowehl.com\/img2.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/chomp.com","title":"Chomp"}]}

PHP to generate that JSON in case you want to play:

--------
$marks = array(
    array('url' => 'http://rowehl.com/', 'title' => 'Mike Rocks!'), 
    array('url' => 'http://rowehl.com/img2.jpg'),
    array('url' => 'http://chomp.com', 'title' => 'Chomp')
    );                                                                              
echo json_encode(array('bookmarks' => $marks));
--------

In the app itself you just need to put in the URL and hit the sync button.
It's just that easy!
